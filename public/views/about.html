<h1>About</h1>
<p>How can I retrieve BibTeX entries? This question is being asked over and over again. We decided to address this question and implement a simple web interface that, when entered a digital object identifier (DOI), returns the BibTeX entry. We hope to simplify the citation process through this service in the best interest of research.</p>

<p>Using our service, you will get the best possible result. We retrieve citation records directly from publishers through public interfaces provided by <a href="http://www.doi.org">The International DOI Foundation</a> and <a href="http://crossref.org">Crossref</a>. Nevertheless, BibTeX entries might contain errors, so we strongly recommend to always check them for completeness and correctness.</p>

<p>It makes us happy to see that people use our service for their research/work. You can make us even happier when you <a href="http://twitter.com/doi2bib">tweet about us (@doi2bib)</a> or tell the world about <a href="doi2bib.org">doi2bib</a> in any other possible way.</p>

<p>We will do our best to keep this service free of charge and free of ads.</p>
